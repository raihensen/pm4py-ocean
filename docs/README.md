# PM4Py Documentation

This documentation provides an overview of the PM4PY process mining library in Python.  It has been split into the following sections for easier navigation:

- [Handling Event Data](01_handling_event_data.md):  Reading and writing event data.
- [Filtering Event Data](02_filtering_event_data.md):  Filtering event data.
- [Object-Centric Event Logs](03_object-centric_event_logs.md):  Object-centric process mining support.
- [Process Discovery](04_process_discovery.md):  Available process discovery algorithms.
- [Petri Net management](05_petri_net_management.md):  Petri net management utilities.
- [Conformance Checking](06_conformance_checking.md):  Conformance checking algorithms (TBR, alignments) available in pm4py.
- [Process Trees](07_process_trees.md): Utilities to manage process trees.
- [Feature Selection](08_feature_selection.md): Feature selection (and ML) methods available in pm4py.
- [Statistics](09_statistics.md): Statistics over event logs available in pm4py.
- [Log-Model Evaluation](10_log-model_evaluation.md): Fitness, precision, generalization, and simplicity metrics.
- [Simulation](11_simulation.md): Simulation (play-out, generation process trees, Monte Carlo) methods.
- [Social Network Analysis](12_social_network_analysis.md): Social network analysis and organizational network analysis.
- [BPMN Support](13_bpmn_support.md): BPMN support in pm4py.
